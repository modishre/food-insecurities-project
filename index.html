    <p class="groove"> <h1>Food Insecurity in the United States</h1> </p>
    <h5>Rachel Cassway, Brady Duncan, Shreya Modi, Vivian Weigel</h5>

    <div>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <center>Food insecurity is defined as "a lack of consistent access to enough food (of nutritional value) for every
            person in a household to live an active, healthy life." (Feeding America)
                <br>Currently over 34 million people in the US are food insecure.
            </center>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The domain area our project addresses is the National level of food insecurity prevalent. The main issue is
            that it is known that there are concentrations of food disparity and low of accessibility all over the US, but there
            is lack of proper representation and awareness. It is important to understand and clearly visualize where
            and how individuals are struggling throughout the nation, creating a path for a more concrete solution plan to
            be synthesized. A specific use case for the tool we are creating would be an USDA employee seeking
            supporting evidence for a research project or grant, that would build food pantries in food-insecure
            locations. In such a scenario, they could use the map to find counties with severe accessibility imbalances,
            and identify those as focus points. Additionally, Congress Representatives like Jim McGovern
            (MA) and Mary Gay Scanlon (PA) could use this resource to continue to stress the importance of
            significant efforts to eliminate food deserts and food insecurity in an easily digestible and powerful
            manner. As government and state representatives, at most it can be assumed they have the ability and or resources
            to understand how to navigate the US map, and then apply though the help of our visualizations where the
            concentrations are and where efforts are most needed.
            <center> Our goal is to make the tool as user-friendly as
            possible, in the way that can best represent the communities that are struggling.
            Understanding that there is the imminent issue of inadequate food accessibility
            in the US, we can make the conscious effort to address food apartheid, as systematic change is needed.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <section>
            <h4>Data</h4>
            <p>This dashboard utilizes data from the Food Access Research Atlas. This atlas contains comprehensive
                data about food access in each census tract. The Economic Research Service, a sector of the US
                Department of Agriculture, gathered this data for the purpose of analyzing food access. Much of the
                data comes from the 2010 US Census including population data, race, and ethnicity. Income, vehicle
                availability, and SNAP participation data are from the 2014-18 American Community Survey. The US Census
                data is one of the most comprehensive data sets about the US population and is often the best possible
                look at the state of the US. However, there is a response bias within the data. People are asked to
                complete the US census, and the survey is adjusted using statistical methods to attempt to make the
                sample representative of the population. However, there is a non-response bias where the people who do
                respond are not representative of the overall US population. Oftentimes, minorities, immigrants, and
                those in poverty are underrepresented by the data because they have not been informed of the census
                and its importance, or have the time and resources to complete. This means that the number of people
                with food insecurity is likely artificially low. However, this data is still informative and while
                keeping the bias in mind, can lead to some provocative analysis. In order to best utilize the data, some
                cleaning was performed. Thirteen columns of the data were selected that were important to the
                specific analysis that was performed. The data was filtered for rows that had the marker 1
                (signifying true) for the column indicating a low access tract with residents living greater
                than 1 mile (urban) or 20 miles (rural) from a supermarket.
